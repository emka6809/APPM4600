# 4. I chose to re-evaluate the inverse of J when the difference
#       between the previous two iterates was greater than 0.01.

#   Compared to my lab partner's version with the difference between
#       the iterates being 0.5, my slacker newton method converged much
#       slower, with almsot double the amount of iterations to converge
#       and time taken to perform them.
